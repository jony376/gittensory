# Ensure every Docker Compose secret file docker-compose.yml's `gittensory` service references
# actually exists on disk, so `docker compose build`/`up` never fails on a missing `secrets:` source
# file -- Compose requires the file to exist even for an operator who has never touched this feature
# and is relying entirely on inline .env values (see secrets/README.md: an inline value always wins
# over the file, so a placeholder here is a pure no-op for that operator).
#
# MODE 644, NOT 600 (#secrets-uid-mismatch, a real incident on edge-nl-01 -- see docker-compose.yml's
# own secrets: comment for the full "why"): standalone Compose secrets are a plain bind mount, which
# cannot remap in-container ownership the way Swarm secrets can -- the container reads this file AS
# ITS OWN uid (the Dockerfile's `USER node`, 1000), essentially never the deploying host user's uid, so
# an owner-only 600 file is unreadable to the app and load-file-secrets.ts's readFileSync throws. 644
# is the minimum that works portably across arbitrary host/container uid pairs without requiring the
# operator's host to have a matching uid or group -- this trades host-local-user readability (a lower
# bar: requires an actual shell on this machine) for what the original hardening was actually about:
# no longer visible via `docker inspect`/`docker compose config`/full env-var dumps.
#
# IDEMPOTENT AND NON-DESTRUCTIVE: creates any MISSING file empty at 644. For a file that already exists,
# self-heals the mode to 644 ONLY while it is still empty (a placeholder, never populated, so nothing to
# protect via 600 in the first place) -- the instant an operator writes a real secret into it, its size is
# no longer zero, so this leaves both its content AND whatever permissions they set entirely alone. Safe
# to run on every deploy, unconditionally.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/selfhost-init-secrets.sh
