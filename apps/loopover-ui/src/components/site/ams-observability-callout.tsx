// AMS (loopover-miner) observability cross-reference (#5191). A dual-role self-hoster running both ORB (the
// review service) and AMS (the miner) on one box otherwise has no in-app pointer from the operations / quickstart /
// workflow docs to the miner's observability setup. Keeping the callout — and its link target — in one place keeps
// the wording byte-identical across all three routes instead of relying on three hand-copied copies staying in sync.
//
// The target is the "Observing your miner" guide: the single AMS observability entry point, which covers pointing
// Grafana at the redacted AMS ledger datasources AND loading an AMS dashboard from grafana/dashboards/. It now has
// its own in-app /docs/ams-observability route (#6024, ported from the source packages/loopover-miner/docs/observability.md
// this constant used to point at directly) -- an in-app Link keeps the reader on the docs site instead of bouncing
// to GitHub.
