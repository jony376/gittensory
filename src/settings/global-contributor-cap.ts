// Install-wide contributor open-item cap (#2562, anti-abuse): a self-hosted install that gates multiple repos
// shares ONE database, but the per-repo contributorOpenPrCap/contributorOpenIssueCap (repository-settings.ts)
// only ever counts open items on the SAME repo -- an actor spreading low-volume spam/farming PRs across several
// gated repos in that install never trips any single repo's cap. This is cross-REPO-within-one-install only (no
// federation, no cross-instance privacy design): a same-database aggregate against every repo this install
// already tracks. Deliberately an env var (not a per-repo `.gittensory.yml`/DB field like the caps above) --
// this setting aggregates ACROSS repos, so it cannot be "this repo's" setting; it belongs to the install as a
// whole, mirroring how global_contributor_blacklist is a tenant-free singleton rather than a per-repo column.
// Off by default (unset/invalid ⇒ null ⇒ no cap): zero behavior change for a single-repo install or one that
// hasn't opted in.
