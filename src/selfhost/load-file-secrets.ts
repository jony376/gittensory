// A missing or unreadable `<NAME>_FILE` fails the container fast (throws), matching the miner package's
// `loadMinerFileSecrets` behavior documented in packages/loopover-miner/DEPLOYMENT.md — rather than
// silently leaving the target env var unset and proceeding without the credential (#6284).

// convention, so they must never be dereferenced below. `COMPOSE_FILE` is a colon-delimited list of
// compose file paths (never a single readable file itself, so readFileSync always throws), and
// `COMPOSE_ENV_FILE` (less commonly set, but equally reserved by Compose) points at an operator's custom
// .env file, not a secret. Excluding both by name is the fix (#4403) -- a real operator secret is never
// named exactly one of these.
