      <h2>The six scenarios</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Current gated</strong> — what's scoreable right now, given all current gates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Underlying potential</strong> — the upper bound implied by the work itself,
          ignoring gates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clean-gate</strong> — what becomes scoreable if branch hygiene issues are
          resolved.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>After-pending-merges</strong> — projection assuming pending related PRs merge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Linked-issue-fixed</strong> — projection assuming the linked issue is closed
          cleanly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Best reasonable case</strong> — the realistic upper bound across known cleanups.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Language rules</h2>
      <p>
        Use <code>scoreability</code>, <code>estimated score</code>,{" "}
        <code>underlying potential</code>, and <code>risk-adjusted priority</code>. Never say{" "}
        <em>guaranteed payout</em>, <em>guaranteed reward</em>, or anything implying outcome
        guarantees.
